# synchronized.dance — System Reference

This is an event ticketing system for dance parties. It is deliberately minimal: no backend server, no database — just Google Forms, Google Sheets, Google Apps Script, and static HTML pages hosted on Cloudflare Pages.

---

## Architecture Overview

**Cash orders** (no upfront payment — pay at door):
```
Attendee fills Google Form (chooses Cash)
        ↓
onFormSubmitHandler: writes row to Purchases with payment_confirmed = TRUE
        ↓
Immediately generates tickets + sends ticket email
        ↓
Attendee visits tickets.html?event=<event_id>&k=<purchase_key>
        ↓
Door staff scans QR → cash modal → swipe to confirm + mark scanned
```

**QR orders** (prepay via bank transfer):
```
Attendee fills Google Form (chooses QR, uploads screenshot)
        ↓
Google Sheet (Purchases tab) — row written with payment_confirmed = FALSE
        ↓
Organizer verifies screenshot, manually sets payment_confirmed = TRUE
        ↓
Apps Script onEdit trigger fires → generates tickets → sends ticket email
        ↓
Attendee visits tickets.html?k=<purchase_key>
        ↓
Door staff scans QR with scanner.html?k=<scanner_token>
        ↓
Apps Script validates + marks ticket as scanned
```

## File Structure

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `index.html` | Landing page — lists active event buttons + email signup form |
| `signup.html` | Email list signup (standalone page, same Brevo form as index.html) |
| `tickets.html` | Buyer-facing ticket viewer — loads per-event theme, shows QR codes |
| `scanner.html` | Door staff scanner — validates tickets across all active events |
| `ambassador.html` | Ambassador dashboard — per-event referral QRs + live earnings stats |
| `ambassador-signup.html` | Pitch page the organizer shows to potential ambassadors |
| `events.json` | Registry of all events — read by index.html and ambassador.html at runtime |
| `events/<event_id>/` | Per-event folder (see Event Folder Structure below) |
| `scripts/app_script.gs` | Google Apps Script (local copy only — see Deployment below) |
| `config.js` | Committed to git — holds `WEB_APP_URL` and `AMBASSADOR_SIGNUP_FORM_URL` |
| `_redirects` | Cloudflare Pages redirect rules (e.g. `/join` → ambassador signup form) |
| `assets/` | Shared assets: NEXA logo, background video/image, Google Maps icon |
| `_headers` | Cloudflare Pages response headers |
| `wrangler.jsonc` | Cloudflare Pages config |

### Event Folder Structure

Each event lives in `events/<event_id>/` where `event_id` follows the convention:
`<dd_mm_yyyy>-<event_name>`

Example: `events/27_06_2026-beach_party/`

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `poster.webp` | Event poster image (provided by organizer) |
| `theme.css` | CSS variable overrides + body background for this event's palette |
| `index.html` | Event landing page — poster, map link, ticket purchase button |

Cloudflare Pages serves `events/<event_id>/index.html` at the URL `/events/<event_id>/`.

`tickets.html` loads the theme via `<link rel="stylesheet" href="/events/<event_id>/theme.css">` — injected early (before API call) from the `?event=` URL param, and also after the API returns the event object.

---

## New Event Setup Procedure

When the user says "set up a new event" and points to an event folder (or creates one), follow these steps in order. This is the authoritative checklist for Claude to use in future sessions.

### Step 1 — Parse the folder name
Folder: `events/<dd_mm_yyyy>-<event_name>/`
Extract: date, event name (spaces from underscores).

### Step 2 — Analyze the poster
Read `events/<event_id>/poster.webp` visually. Identify dominant colors. Generate `events/<event_id>/theme.css` with matching CSS vars and body background. See **CSS Theming Guide** below for the exact variables to set.

### Step 3 — Ask the user for these details
- Google Maps URL for the venue
- Ticket form URL (the `viewform` URL of the new Google Form for this event)
- Ticket form prefill entry ID (see "Getting the Referral Code pre-fill entry ID" in Ambassador Program section)
- Event time (e.g. `4PM – 12AM`)
- Venue name (display name)
- Venue address (full address for emails)
- Artists/headliners (for the event-info section on tickets)
- Genres (listed in `events.json` but not part of the folder name)

### Step 4 — Create `events/<event_id>/index.html`
Event landing page. Use the same structure as `events/27_06_2026-beach_party/index.html` as a template. Update: title, meta description, date, event name, venue info, form URL, maps URL. Also update the Open Graph tags (`og:title`, `og:description`, `og:image`, `og:url`) — set `og:image` to `https://synchronized.dance/events/<event_id>/poster.webp` so shared links show the poster.

### Step 5 — Update `events.json`
Add a new entry to the array. Required fields:
```json
{
  "id": "<event_id>",
  "date_iso": "YYYY-MM-DD",
  "date_display": "Month DD",
  "name": "Event Name",
  "genres": ["Genre1", "Genre2"],
  "time": "Xpm – Yam",
  "venue": "Venue Name",
  "address": "Full address",
  "maps_url": "https://maps.app.goo.gl/...",
  "ticket_form_url": "https://docs.google.com/forms/d/.../viewform",
  "ticket_form_prefill_entry": "entry.XXXXXXXXXX",
  "accent_color": "#rrggbb"
}
```
Pick `accent_color` from the poster's dominant warm hue.

### Step 6 — Add event to `scripts/app_script.gs` EVENTS map
Add a new entry to the `EVENTS` object using the event ID as the key:
```javascript
'<event_id>': {
  EVENT_NAME:    'Event Name',
  EVENT_DATE:    'Month DD',
  EVENT_TIME:    'Xpm – Yam',
  EVENT_VENUE:   'Venue Name',
  EVENT_ADDRESS: 'Full address',
  COMMISSION_PER_TICKET: 5,
},
```
The key must exactly match the event folder name / form responses tab name.

### Step 7 — Output the manual checklist
Print this for the user:
```
Manual steps remaining:
[ ] Copy updated app_script.gs to Google Apps Script editor → Deploy new version
[ ] Create new Google Form for this event (ticket types, prices, payment method, referral code field)
[ ] Link the new form to the spreadsheet (Form editor → Responses → Link to spreadsheet)
[ ] In Google Sheets, rename the new "Form Responses X" tab to the event ID (e.g. 27_06_2026-beach_party)
[ ] Add event_id column to Purchases tab (if not already there)
[ ] Add event_id column to Tickets tab (if not already there)
[ ] Install onFormSubmitHandler trigger for the new responses tab
[ ] Get the referral code prefill entry ID and confirm it matches events.json
[ ] Copy poster.webp into events/<event_id>/ if not already there
```

## config.js

This file is committed to git. It holds URLs that the HTML pages read at load time.

```javascript
window.WEB_APP_URL = 'https://script.google.com/macros/s/YOUR_DEPLOYMENT_ID/exec';
window.AMBASSADOR_SIGNUP_FORM_URL = 'https://synchronized.dance/join';
```

`tickets.html`, `scanner.html`, `ambassador.html`, and `ambassador-signup.html` all load `config.js` via `<script src="config.js">`.

Per-event ticket form URLs and prefill entry IDs now live in `events.json`, not `config.js`. `ambassador.html` shows a single referral QR pointing at the homepage (`?ref=<key>`); `index.html` reads that `ref` and appends it to each active event's form prefill from `events.json`.

---

## Google Apps Script Deployment

**The file `scripts/app_script.gs` is a local copy only.** Changes here do NOT automatically update the live system.

To deploy changes:
1. Open the Google Apps Script project in the browser editor
2. Paste the updated contents of `app_script.gs`
3. Click **Deploy → Manage deployments → New version** (do NOT edit the existing deployment — create a new version under the same deployment ID)
4. The `/exec` URL stays the same across versions

Triggers that must be manually set up in the Apps Script editor:
- `onFormSubmitHandler` — trigger type: **From spreadsheet → On form submit**
- `onAmbassadorSignupHandler` — trigger type: **From spreadsheet → On form submit**
- `onEditHandler` — trigger type: **From spreadsheet → On edit**

**Re-authorization after script changes:** If you add new Google service calls (e.g. switching from `MailApp` to `GmailApp`), the script needs new OAuth scopes. After deploying, open the Apps Script editor, select any function in the dropdown, and click **Run** — this triggers the authorization prompt. Click **Review permissions → Allow**.

## Google Sheet Structure

### Tabs

| Tab | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `Purchases` | One row per form submission / purchase |
| `Tickets` | One row per individual ticket (multiple per purchase) |
| `Scanners` | One row per scanner token (for door staff auth) |
| `Ambassadors` | One row per ambassador — keys, stats, payment details |
| `Summary` | Organizer-facing totals — updated by "Refresh ambassador stats" |
| `Form Responses 1` | Raw ticket purchase form responses (don't modify) |
| `Form Responses 2` | Raw ambassador signup form responses (don't modify) |

### Purchases tab — critical columns

| Column | Notes |
|---|---|
| `event_id` | Matches the event folder name — written from `CONFIG.EVENT_ID` |
| `purchase_id` | Unique ID for the purchase |
| `purchase_key` | Secret key used in the buyer's ticket URL (`?event=...&k=`) |
| `payment_method` | `qr` or `cash` — normalized in `onFormSubmitHandler` |
| `payment_confirmed` | Set to `TRUE` by organizer to trigger ticket generation + email |
| `tickets_generated` | Set to `TRUE` by script after `generateTicketsForRow` runs |
| `buyer_ticket_url` | Full URL sent in the email — includes `?event=<EVENT_ID>&k=<key>` |

### Tickets tab — critical columns

| Column | Notes |
|---|---|
| `event_id` | Copied from Purchases at ticket generation — matches event folder name |
| `ticket_id` | The string encoded in the QR code |
| `purchase_id` | Foreign key back to Purchases |
| `ticket_type` | Full form option text (e.g. "General Admission — RM55 (...)") |
| `payment_method` | Copied from Purchases at ticket generation — must exist in this tab |
| `affiliate_code` | Copied from Purchases at ticket generation — must exist for ambassador tracking |
| `scanned` | Set to `TRUE` when validated at the door |

**Important:** `payment_method` and `affiliate_code` must be columns in the **Tickets** tab, not just Purchases. The API reads from Tickets for validation responses, and ambassador stats only count tickets where `affiliate_code` matches AND `scanned = TRUE`.

### Scanners tab

Each row has a token that door staff use in their URL (`scanner.html?k=<token>`). The `check_scanner` action validates this token.

### Ambassadors tab — critical columns

| Column | Notes |
|---|---|
| `ambassador_key` | Secret token — used as both the URL key (`ambassador.html?k=`) and the affiliate code stored in Purchases/Tickets |
| `name` | From signup form |
| `email` | From signup form |
| `phone` | From signup form |
| `business` | From signup form |
| `payment_details` | Bank details or QR file link — from signup form |
| `tickets_sold` | Updated by "Refresh ambassador stats" menu action |
| `amount_earned` | `tickets_sold × COMMISSION_PER_TICKET` — updated by menu action |
| `amount_paid` | Organizer fills in manually after payout |
| `amount_owing` | `amount_earned - amount_paid` — updated by menu action |
| `ambassador_page_url` | Full URL to `ambassador.html?k=TOKEN` — generated on signup |
| `created_at` | Signup timestamp |

**Also add to Purchases tab:** `affiliate_code` — populated from the "Referral Code" field in the ticket purchase form (or empty if no referral).

**Also add to Tickets tab:** `affiliate_code` — copied from Purchases at ticket generation time, same as `payment_method`.

### Purchases tab — affiliate tracking

`affiliate_code` stores the `ambassador_key` of the referring ambassador. It comes from the "Referral Code" field in the Google Form, which ambassadors' QR codes pre-fill automatically.

---

## Apps Script: CONFIG and EVENTS

`app_script.gs` has two top-level objects:

**`CONFIG`** — shared settings that don't change per event:
```javascript
const CONFIG = {
  PURCHASES_TAB: 'Purchases',
  TICKETS_TAB: 'Tickets',
  SCANNERS_TAB: 'Scanners',
  AMBASSADORS_TAB: 'Ambassadors',
  AMBASSADOR_FORM_RESPONSES_TAB: 'Ambassador Signups',
  SUMMARY_TAB: 'Summary',
  TICKETS_PAGE_URL:    'https://synchronized.dance/tickets.html',
  SCANNER_PAGE_URL:    'https://synchronized.dance/scanner.html',
  AMBASSADOR_PAGE_URL: 'https://synchronized.dance/ambassador.html',
};
```

**`EVENTS`** — one entry per event, keyed by event ID. The key must exactly match the event folder name AND the form responses tab name in the sheet (rename the tab after linking the form):
```javascript
const EVENTS = {
  '27_06_2026-beach_party': {
    EVENT_NAME:    'Beach Party',
    EVENT_DATE:    'June 27',
    EVENT_TIME:    '4PM – 12AM',
    EVENT_VENUE:   'Northern Cove, Penang',
    EVENT_ADDRESS: '515 Jalan C M Hashim, Tanjung Tokong, George Town',
    COMMISSION_PER_TICKET: 5,
  },
};
```

`onFormSubmitHandler` identifies which event a form submission belongs to by reading the sheet tab name (`e.range.getSheet().getName()`) and looking it up in `EVENTS`. This is why renaming the tab to the event ID is required. The ambassador signup form tab stays fixed as `'Ambassador Signups'` — `onAmbassadorSignupHandler` guards against that tab name specifically.

---

## API Endpoints

The Apps Script is deployed as a web app and responds to GET requests with JSON.

### `?action=check_scanner&k=<token>`
Validates a scanner token. Returns `{ok: true, name: "..."}` or `{ok: false}`.

### `?action=get_tickets&k=<purchase_key>`
Returns all tickets for a purchase:
```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "buyer_name": "Jane",
  "tickets": [
    {
      "ticket_id": "ABC123",
      "ticket_type": "General Admission",
      "payment_method": "cash",
      "scanned": false
    }
  ]
}
```

### `?action=validate&ticket_id=<ticket_id>&token=<scanner_token>`
Validates a scanned ticket. Uses a script lock to prevent double-admit. Returns:
```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "status": "valid",
  "buyer_name": "Jane",
  "ticket_type": "General Admission",
  "payment_method": "cash",
  "ticket_index": 1,
  "ticket_total": 2
}
```
Possible `status` values: `valid`, `cash_due`, `already_scanned`, `invalid`, `unauthorized`.

**Cash orders are NOT marked scanned by `validate`** — they return `status: "cash_due"` and stay unused until the door staff confirm payment (see `confirm_cash`). Non-cash orders are marked scanned immediately.

### `?action=confirm_cash&ticket_id=<ticket_id>&token=<scanner_token>`
Called when door staff swipe to confirm cash was collected for a cash order. Marks the ticket scanned and returns the same shape as `validate` with `status: "valid"` (or `already_scanned`). Until this succeeds the ticket stays unused, so a guest who can't pay can simply be re-scanned later.

### `?action=get_ambassador&key=<ambassador_key>`
Returns live stats for an ambassador. Ticket counts are computed from the Tickets tab at query time.
```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "name": "Jane",
  "business": "Zouk KL",
  "tickets_sold": 5,
  "amount_earned": 25,
  "amount_paid": 0,
  "amount_owing": 25,
  "commission_per_ticket": 5
}
```

**Debugging tip:** The `/exec` URL redirects, so DevTools Network tab shows "no content." To see the raw JSON, copy the full request URL and paste it directly into a browser tab.

---

## Payment Flow (Cash vs QR)

Google Form has a "Payment method" multiple-choice field with options like "QR" and "Cash (pay at the door)".

`onFormSubmitHandler` normalizes the value:
```javascript
rawPaymentType.startsWith('cash') ? 'cash' : rawPaymentType.startsWith('qr') ? 'qr' : rawPaymentType
```
So any cash-flavored option stores as `cash`, any QR-flavored option stores as `qr`.

This value flows: **Purchases tab → Tickets tab → API responses → frontend**.

### Cash orders — auto-confirmed on form submit

Cash orders skip the manual verification step. In `onFormSubmitHandler`:
- `payment_confirmed` is written as `true` immediately
- `generateTicketsForRow` and `sendTicketEmail` are called right away
- No order confirmation email is sent — the ticket email is the only email

The organizer does **not** need to touch the sheet for cash orders. The buyer receives their QR tickets immediately with a note to pay cash at the door.

### QR orders — organizer confirms manually

- `payment_confirmed` is written as `false`
- Organizer verifies the payment screenshot, then sets `payment_confirmed = TRUE` in the sheet
- `onEditHandler` fires, generates tickets, and sends the ticket email
- An order confirmation email is sent at form submit time to acknowledge receipt

### tickets.html (buyer view)
- Cash tickets show a yellow `💵 Pay Cash at Door` banner below the QR
- The status pill reads "Cash Due" (styled differently) instead of "Live"

### scanner.html (door staff)
- Scanning a cash ticket returns `cash_due` — the ticket is **not** marked scanned yet — and triggers a special modal with a swipe-to-confirm gesture
- Swiping calls the `confirm_cash` endpoint, which is what actually marks the ticket scanned. If the buyer can't pay, don't swipe — the ticket stays valid and can be re-scanned
- Non-cash tickets are admitted on scan and show the result in a normal modal requiring an OK tap

---

## Ticket Type Display

The full Google Form option text (e.g. `"General Admission — RM55 (Includes one free drink)"`) is stored in the sheet as-is. The function `shortTicketType()` in Apps Script strips everything from the em dash or ` - ` onward:

```javascript
function shortTicketType(t) {
  return String(t).split('—')[0].split(' - ')[0].trim();
}
```

This shortened label is what the API returns in `ticket_type` and what shows on the scanner modal, the ticket page status pills, and in the email subject.

---

## CSS Theming Guide

When a new event poster is provided, update the color palette in both `scanner.html` and `tickets.html` to match the poster's vibe. Both files share an identical CSS variable system.

### Variables to update (`:root` block, near top of `<style>`)

```css
:root {
  --night: #080c1a;      /* darkest background — usually keep very dark */
  --ember: #0d1630;      /* secondary background layer */
  --amber: #ff7035;      /* primary warm accent — buttons, dots, highlights */
  --amber-deep: #c84a00; /* darker shade of amber — hover states */
  --gold: #ffc547;       /* secondary highlight — taglines, labels */
  --gold-soft: #ffad3b;  /* softer gold — secondary text accents */
  --flame: #ff4c00;      /* intense accent — error states, particle dots */
  --teal: #0d9488;       /* success/valid color — "scanned" badges, progress */
  --teal-deep: #065f46;  /* darker teal — gradient end in valid badges */
  --red: #ce1126;        /* invalid/rejected — "used" ticket badges */
  --cream: #f4e8d4;      /* body text, light headings */
}
```

**What each variable drives:**
- `--amber` / `--gold`: tagline text, dot separators, QR code frames, event name accents
- `--teal`: "valid" scan modal, "Live" status pill, scanning indicator glow
- `--red`: "invalid"/"used" scan modal (keep red for error clarity)
- `--night` / `--ember`: page background base colors
- `--cream`: all body text — keep light for readability on dark bg

### Body background gradients to update

In `body { background: ... }`, the raw RGBA values reference the poster's dominant colors. Change these to match the new palette:

```css
body {
  background:
    radial-gradient(ellipse 90% 60% at 50% 0%, rgba(255, 120, 50, 0.4) 0%, transparent 55%),
    /* ↑ warm glow at top — use the poster's dominant warm hue */
    radial-gradient(ellipse 100% 70% at 50% 35%, rgba(200, 70, 0, 0.2) 0%, transparent 60%),
    /* ↑ mid-page warmth — slightly darker variant of above */
    radial-gradient(ellipse 60% 40% at 80% 80%, rgba(13, 148, 136, 0.18) 0%, transparent 60%),
    /* ↑ cool accent bottom-right — use the poster's secondary cool hue */
    linear-gradient(180deg, var(--ember) 0%, var(--night) 60%, var(--ember) 100%);
    /* ↑ base layer — driven by --ember and --night vars */
}
```

### Particle dots (`tickets.html` only — `body::after`)

These are tiny dot accents scattered across the top half. Update the colors inline:
```css
body::after {
  background-image:
    radial-gradient(circle 2px at 15% 20%, var(--gold), transparent),
    radial-gradient(circle 1px at 80% 30%, var(--teal), transparent),
    /* ... etc — driven by vars, no raw values to change */
}
```
These update automatically when you change `--gold`, `--teal`, `--amber`, `--flame`.

### Noise overlay (`body::before`)

The SVG noise texture in `body::before` stays the same regardless of theme — it's a subtle grain effect. The `feColorMatrix` inside it has hardcoded warm-tint values (`1 0.7 0.3`) which can be adjusted if the new theme is very cool/blue, but usually leave it.

### index.html

`index.html` does not use the CSS variable system — it uses raw `background.jpg`/`background.mp4`. For a new event:
- Replace `assets/poster.webp` with the new poster
- Bump the cache-bust version: `src="assets/poster.webp?v=2"`
- Replace `assets/background.mp4` / `assets/background.jpg` if there's new atmosphere footage
- Update the Google Form link (`href` on the ticket button)
- Update the Google Maps link (`href` on the map icon)

---

## Ambassador Program

Ambassadors are people or businesses who refer ticket buyers and earn a commission per confirmed (scanned) ticket.

### Flow

1. Organizer opens `ambassador-signup.html` and shows it to a potential ambassador — they scan the QR to open the signup form.
2. Ambassador fills the signup form → `onAmbassadorSignupHandler` fires → creates row in Ambassadors tab → sends welcome email with their unique `ambassador.html?k=TOKEN` URL.
3. Ambassador opens their page, finds their referral QR, and shares it. The QR encodes the site homepage with their key as `?ref=<ambassador_key>` (`https://synchronized.dance/?ref=KEY`) — one QR that works for every active event.
4. Buyers scan the ambassador's QR → land on `index.html`, which reads `?ref=` and links each event button straight to that event's Google Form with the referral pre-filled (using `ticket_form_url` + `ticket_form_prefill_entry` from `events.json`). They complete the purchase normally.
5. `onFormSubmitHandler` reads the Referral Code and stores it as `affiliate_code` in the Purchases row. `generateTicketsForRow` copies it to each Ticket row.
6. At the door, when a ticket is scanned (and cash is confirmed for cash orders), it becomes "confirmed." The ambassador's stats update automatically — `get_ambassador` counts scanned Tickets with matching `affiliate_code`.
7. After the event, organizer runs **Ticket System → Refresh ambassador stats** to update the Ambassadors tab, then pays out based on `amount_owing` using the `payment_details` on file.

### Triggers required

Two form-submit triggers must be installed in the Apps Script editor:
- `onFormSubmitHandler` — fired by ticket purchase form
- `onAmbassadorSignupHandler` — fired by ambassador signup form

Both are "From spreadsheet → On form submit" triggers. `onFormSubmitHandler` looks up the tab name in `EVENTS` — if not found, it exits immediately. `onAmbassadorSignupHandler` checks the tab name against `CONFIG.AMBASSADOR_FORM_RESPONSES_TAB` (`'Ambassador Signups'`). Neither function needs updating when adding a new event — just rename the tab and add to `EVENTS`.

### No script properties required

All page URLs (`TICKETS_PAGE_URL`, `SCANNER_PAGE_URL`, `AMBASSADOR_PAGE_URL`) live directly in the `CONFIG` object at the top of `app_script.gs`. The **First-time setup** menu item now just shows a confirmation — no manual property setting is needed.

### Getting the Referral Code pre-fill entry ID

After adding the "Referral Code" field to the ticket purchase form:
1. Form → ⋮ menu → **Get pre-filled link**
2. Type any value in Referral Code → **Get link** → copy URL
3. Extract the `entry.XXXXXXXXXX` part
4. Set it as `ticket_form_prefill_entry` on that event's entry in `events.json` (per-event, not global).

The ambassador QR encodes the homepage with `?ref=<ambassador_key>`. `index.html` then builds each event's purchase link as `ticket_form_url + '?' + ticket_form_prefill_entry + '=' + ref`.

---

## Email Sending

All emails (ticket confirmation, order confirmation, ambassador welcome) are sent via `GmailApp.sendEmail()` with:
```javascript
from: 'nexa.events.marketing@gmail.com',
name: 'Nexa Events',
```

**Setup required for the `from:` alias to work:**
1. In your personal Gmail: Settings → See all settings → **Accounts and Import** → **Send mail as** → add `nexa.events.marketing@gmail.com` and verify it
2. After deploying a script version that uses `GmailApp`, run any function manually in the Apps Script editor to trigger re-authorization (GmailApp requires the `gmail.send` OAuth scope)

If emails send but arrive from the wrong address, the alias isn't verified or the script hasn't been re-authorized.

---

## Google Forms Notes

- Conditional logic (show/hide questions based on previous answer) is supported natively via the form editor — useful for showing a QR upload field only if QR payment is selected
- Forms cannot be version-controlled in git; changes are made directly in the form editor
- The form must include a "Payment method" field (case-insensitive — `findCol()` in the script handles it)
- The referral/affiliate code field is matched by searching for "referral" or "ambassador" as a substring — the question can be named e.g. "Referral Code (ignore)" or "Ambassador code (Ignore)"
- Ambassador signup bank detail fields are matched by: "bank name" or "name of bank", "account number", "account owner" — order of words in the question title doesn't matter

---

## Hosting

Deployed on **Cloudflare Pages** (see `wrangler.jsonc`). Static files only — no server-side logic. The `_headers` file sets response headers (caching, security).

`config.js` is committed to git and deployed automatically with the rest of the site.

### Redirects (`_redirects`)

Cloudflare Pages processes `_redirects` at the repo root. Current rules:

| From | To | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `/join` | Google ambassador signup form | QR codes and `ambassador-signup.html` point here — update this line if the form URL ever changes, then push |

Set `window.AMBASSADOR_SIGNUP_FORM_URL = 'https://synchronized.dance/join'` in `config.js` so the QR on `ambassador-signup.html` encodes the short URL, not the raw Google Form link.
